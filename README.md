Attempt at authenticating a HTTP request with client certificates in iOS through a phonegap plugin.

A finished implementation allows Cordova/Phonegap users to complete mutual authentication by validating thier client cdertificate with the server.

I'm using the native Objective C code from Xander Dumaine's blog:

It seems the Objective C API's used are derecated, and the cordova plugin API has been updated.

If you want to make anything of this, have a crack. Would be very useful to the community.

As I'm not a Objective C developer, I'm abandoning this. Have fun with it.
